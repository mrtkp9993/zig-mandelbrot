# Zig Mandelbrot Set Generator

A simple Mandelbrot set fractal generator written in Zig that outputs PPM image files.

## Building

```bash
zig build --release=safe
```

## Usage

```bash
zig-mandelbrot <width> <height>
```

Example:
```bash
zig-mandelbrot 800 600
```

This generates `output.ppm` with the specified dimensions.

## Implementation

The program calculates the Mandelbrot set using the iterative formula:

```
z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c
```

Where:
- `c` is a complex number representing each pixel
- `z` starts at 0
- Points that don't escape to infinity (|z| > 2) after max iterations are in the set

The complex plane is mapped to:
- Real axis: [-2.5, 1.0]
- Imaginary axis: [-1.0, 1.0]

## Output

Creates a PPM (Portable Pixel Map) P6 format image file that can be viewed with most image viewers.

![output.ppm](output.ppm)

## Performance

The program prints execution time in milliseconds after completion.
